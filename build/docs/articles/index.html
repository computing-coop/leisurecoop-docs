However, one principle applies in all cases: If the law says &quot;by law&quot;, deviations are not permitted.
The articles of association form the basic order of an association. Written articles of association are required for an association to be legally valid. Aside from the statutory requirements under the CC, the articles are the associationâ€™s own law with which the members and the executive committee must comply.
In principle, all members are subject to the same rights and obligations. If an association intends to deviate from this rule, any such deviation must be specified in the articles of association. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="association">Association<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#association" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1-name-and-registered-office">1.
