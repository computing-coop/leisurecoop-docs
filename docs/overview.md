# Overview

## Intro

Open, inclusive, and regenerative. Leisure Cooperative is an internet company established to share access and further amplify inclusion in leisure time activities. We work as a cooperative towards a common goal. This participatory culture and business model aims to foster land and place-based stewardship. It is with this hope that we wish to provide a shared marketplace for exchanging resources such as good, space, and transportation for play, imagination and idle living.

## Collective Ownership

Leisure Cooperative is working to provide stable jobs and income for its workers, partners and operators. We do this as a participatory and meritocratic organization with 100% transparency. We believe in business as a case of social good.

## Shared Economic Rewards & Power

We turn a profit to pay a living wage for our workers and operators. Instead of investing the profit into tax-havens or other dubious methods many corporations use to withold just taxation, we invest profit into better resources, access and environmental practices for the Leisure Cooperative and its community.
